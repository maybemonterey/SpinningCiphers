<p class="p" style="text-align: center;">Hi! My name is Aarushi Purohit and I'm a high school sophmore with a love of coding. Some things othre than computers I like are books, calisthenics, and graphiic designing! I hope my website was some help to you and keep a look out; I'm always updating new features!</p>

<!--WHAT IS MY INSPIRATION?-->
<h2 class="cipher_title" style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">What is my Inspiration?</h2>
<p class="p" style="text-align: center;">I always had a facination for puzzles, whether they were riddles or mysteries. Ciphers, depending on which ones, are both with a touch of problem solving. THe art of cryptography is a complex one and because of that, I wanted people to be able to understand why they should appreciate it and how it works. In the past, cryptography has always been done by hand and now that we have computers, this art can be done a lot faster with far more accuracy. Appreciating a message's secrets and even writing one yourself is something this website aims to do. </p>

<!--HOW WAS THIS MADE??-->
<h2 class="cipher_title" style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">How was this website made?</h2>
<p class="p">The short answer to that is coffee and sleep a lot of restraint; all three which are essential to any programmer. The long answer, however, you may find more interesting ;) </p>


<p class="p" style="text-align: center;">I built this website using HTML, CSS, JavScript, and some PHP (although that was only used so I wouldn't need to repeat huge blocks of code over and over again). The Encryptors and Decryptors (which are still working I hope), were made using javascript! If you would like to look at my code, feel free to check out my GitHub Repository <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
